  <h4>Brest is a port city in the Finistère department, Brittany.</h4>
  <p> With 139,456 inhabitants (2020), Brest forms Western Brittany's largest metropolitan area (with a population of 370,000 in total), ranking third behind only Nantes and Rennes in the whole of historic Brittany, and the 25th most populous city in France (2019).</p>
  <p>During the Middle Ages, the history of Brest was the history of its castle. Then Richelieu made it a military harbour in 1631.</p>
  <p>Brest's history has since the 17th century been linked to the sea: the Académie de Marine (Naval Academy) was founded in 1752 in this city.</p>
